## Filtering Rows and Columns

You can filter in SQL columns by SELECT and rows by WHERE. Example from the Lahman baseball database, download it and sqldf package first. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Next, enter this code to see see hr totals for 1927 Yankees. Instead of a massive 100,000 entry list, we could write: 

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```
